  "lede": "Our research spans causal discovery, causal representation learning, and causality-aware ML/AI. We develop methods that handle latent confounding, distribution shifts, nonlinear relationships, general data distributions, and selection bias. We study transfer learning, concept learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning through a causal lens, while examining philosophical foundations and ethical issues of AI. Applications include neuroscience, biology, healthcare, computer vision, computational finance, and climate analysis.",
